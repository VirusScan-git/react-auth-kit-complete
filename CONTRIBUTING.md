git checkout -b Branch_Name
```

### 5. Install all dependencies :turtle:

Install project dependencies

```sh
# It will install all necessary dependencies
npm install
```

## Contribution guidelines for documentation

See something that needs fixing? Or something that could be improved? Awesome! here are some guidelines below that'll help you to do just that.

In general, there are two main types of contribution,

- **General improvements:**
    - Typo corrections.
    - Fixing broken refs and links.
    - Correcting inaccurate or out of date info.
    - Offering better explanations through clearer writings and examples.

- **New Pages or features**
    - Adding a page of documentation that we haven't covered yet.
    - Documenting a new feature that has been added to this project since its last release.

### Before Contributing

1. Familiarize yourself with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with which we created the documentation.

2. Read through some of our existing documents and get a feel about the overall structure and style.

### Best Practices

1. All pages must include a proper title and an introduction.

2. If the document contains a technical term, it must be highlighted using \*term\* markdown syntax.

3. If the document contains an acronym or initialism, it should be first introduced highlighted in its expanded form followed by the commonly-accepted abbreviation in brackets (like Free and open-source software (FOSS)).

4. Use paragraphs to introduce a single concept and move on to a new paragraph before introducing another or expanding upon the first concept. Keep the size of those paragraphs to no more than four to five lines.

5. If you find you're putting commas in a sentence consider splitting it into two or more sentences for improved clarity.

6. Split the document up into as many sub-sections as makes sense. This is especially helpful for the readers who want to skip ahead for reference, as we can also use subheads as navigational anchors.
