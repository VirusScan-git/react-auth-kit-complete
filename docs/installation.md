# Installation

React-Auth-Kit is available as a [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-auth-kit).

The package also contains the type definitions, so if you are using TypeScript, this package will also work. You don't have to install any other package.

!!! warning ""

    Using this approach in `production` is `discouraged` though - the client has to download the entire library,
    regardless of which components are actually used, affecting performance and bandwidth utilization.

!!! danger ""

    The UMD links are using the `latest` tag to point to the latest version of the library. This pointer is `unstable`,
    it shifts as we release new versions. You should consider pointing to a specific version,
    such as [v1.4.6](https://unpkg.com/react-auth-kit@2.5.0/dist/index.umd.js).
